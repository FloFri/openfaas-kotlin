## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:

    - If your contribution is minor, such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
    - If your contribution is major, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

If you're unsure about your suggestion, please reach out to me to discuss your idea first.
